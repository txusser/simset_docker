# simset_docker
This is slightly tweaked version of simset (http://depts.washington.edu/simset/html/simset_main.html), which includes a Dockerfile that makes SimSET runable as a Docker container from this repo.

I am not the developer of SimSET, just a user. Full credit for the development of SimSET goes to Professor Robert Harrison in the University of Washington.

Please go to http://depts.washington.edu/simset/html/simset_main.html to be provided with the original code, examples and tutorials.
