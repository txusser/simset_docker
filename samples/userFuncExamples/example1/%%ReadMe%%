Before working in this directory, we suggest going up one
directory (to samples/userFuncExamples) and setting the
endianess of your computer.  To do so, run useLittleend.sh
or useBigend.sh (most computers are littleendian these days).

After returning to this directory, go into the make.files
sub-directory and edit simset.make:
- change SIMSET_PATH to the same path you use for your regular
SimSET builds.
- change SIMSET_PATH_USR to the path for this example directory
(i.e., the path should end in 'samples/userFuncExamples/example1).

Return to the example1 directory and run the script ./make_all.sh.

If everything compiled and linked, you should be ready to go.

To run this example, run the script ./run_addrandUsrSample1.sh.
The example is described in detail in the user function
section of SimSET's user guide,
http://depts.washington.edu/simset/html/user_guide/user_guide_index.html.
