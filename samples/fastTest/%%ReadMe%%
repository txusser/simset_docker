This directory contains a series of sample simulations that form a quick
test of SimSET functionality.  The parameter files for the simulations and
benchmark results are contained in subdirectories of this directory.   Most
benchmark results are from version 2.6.2.6;  simulations using features 
unavailable in 2.6.2.6 use earliest compatible version.  Each subdirectory 
has its own %%ReadMe%% giving a brief description of the simulation in it, 
as well as information about interpreting the results.

fastTest should run, as distributed, on littleendian CPUs.  If your
computer is bigendian, please run useBigend.sh before running
fastTest.

Most of the simulations use a common activity/attenuation object from 
fastTest subdirectory 'object'.  This is a three slice object.  The two 
end slices consist of water with no activity.  The middle slice consists
of 9 voxels in a 3x3 array.  The upper and lower rows of the attenuation
object are bone, the middle row water.  The activity object is a point
source at (6.67, 0, 2).  By looking at the object geometry given in
a *.phgin file in one of the subdirectories, one sees that this will be
in the middle slice in the leftmost voxel in the x-dimension and the
center voxel in the y-dimension.

The tomograph features are described in the subdirectories.

Both the object and the tomographs simulated are quite fanciful.  They
have been chosen to test and demonstrate a wide range of SimSET
features.

The shell script runFast.sh (in this directory) runs all the simulations. 
The shell script resultsFast.sh presents comparisons of the simulation's
results to the benchmark results.

Files ending in "out" give redirected output from runs of the
corresponding shell scripts (e.g., runFast.out is the output from 
runFast.sh) or commands issued in the shell scripts (e.g.,
DHCI/DHCI.phgout is produced by one of the commands in DHCI/runDHCI.sh).

The test requires about 12 GB of free disk space.  This can be
substantially reduced by executing the shell script runFast.noList.sh.
This script does not test any of the list mode features.  To see the
results, run the shell script resultsFast.noList.sh.

These tests are intended to give a quick overview (while still requiring
several hours running time) of whether SimSET is working.  When adding
a new feature, they should help considerably in basic testing of the
new version.  However, they are not intended as a complete test.  In
particular, any new functions, algorithms, inputs and outputs will not
be tested by fastTest:  the tester should design tests specifically for
for such new features.
