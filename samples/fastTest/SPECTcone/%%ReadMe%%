This directory contains parameter files and data for a SimSET simulation. The
simulation can be run using the command runSPECTcone.sh, and the resulting 
data can be analyzed using analyzeSPECTcone.sh.  These commands can also be 
run from the parent directory (along with similar commands in the sibling
directories) using the commands runFast.sh and resultsFast.sh.

The object simulated is described in the %%ReadMe%% file in the parent 
directory. This simulation uses no importance sampling in the object, and 
models coherent scatter in both the object and tomograph.  
(See SPECTcone.phgin.)

The collimator is cone-beam, 40 cm focal length, 3 cm thick, with 0.2 cm hole
radius, and 0.01 cm septal thickness.  (See SPECTcone.colparms.)

The modeled detector has a 0.1 cm aluminum front cover, followed by 2 cm of
NaI and 1.5 cm of BGO.  The detectors have 10% FWHM energy resolution.  
(See SPECTcone.detparms.)

The detector and collimator have 100 step-and-shoot positions.

The data is binned into 5 z bins, 10 transaxial distance bins and 100 
azimuthal angle bins (phi).  (See SPECTcone.binparms.)

The script analyzeSPECTcone.sh compares the results from the two simulations
with results from an earlier version of SimSET.  The comparisons are made 
using the SimSET utility 'ttest', which performs a t-test on the data 
bin-by-bin.  analyzeSPECTcone.sh gives a summary of ttest's output for each 
simulation, e.g.:

Minimum T-Test value = -3.344
Maximum T-Test value = 3.487

0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 1.0          = 1182 => %67.97
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 2.0          = 1671 => %96.09
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.0          = 1733 => %99.65
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.49         = 1739, => %100.00


The absolute value of the ttest should be less than 1 approximately 67% of
the time, less than 2 approximately 95% of the time, and less than 3 over
99% of the time.  For this test the maximum absolute value of the
ttest should be between 2.5 and 4.5.  The random nature of the data may lead
to a higher value on occasion, but the higher value should disappear if
the simulation and analysis are rerun.

If SimSET fails these conditions, further testing may be necessary.  Please
