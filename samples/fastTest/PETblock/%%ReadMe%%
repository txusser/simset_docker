This directory contains parameter files and data for a SimSET simulation. The
simulation can be run using the command runPETblock.sh, and the resulting data
can be analyzed using analyzePETblock.sh.  These commands can also be run from
the parent directory (along with similar commands in the sibling directories)
using the commands runFast.sh and resultsFast.sh.

The PETblock simulation uses a different object than the other fastTest
simulations.  It is a 3cm radius, 3cm long water cylinder with point sources
of equal intensity at (2,2,-1) and (0,0,1). This simulation does not use 
importance sampling in the object, models positron range and non-collinearity, 
and models coherent scatter in the tomograph, but not in the object.  
(See PETblock.phgin.)

No collimator is simulated, though the block detector module can be used
in conjunction with a collimator;  a collimator could be
simulated by uncommenting the line in PETblock.phgin giving the name of the 
collimator parameter file (lines beginning with '#' are comments).

The tomograph consists of a single ring of blocks;  Gaussian energy blurring
of 20% (at a reference energy of 511 keV) is applied (PETblock.detparms).
The ring consists of 8 blocks, all of the same type, placed at 0, 45, ...,
315 degrees (BGO.ringparms).  Each block consists of a 3x3 array of LSO
crystals, 9mmX9mmX25mm each, separated by 1mm of plastic.  The assembley
is housed, front and sides, in 1mm thick aluminum, and at the back with
1mm of plastic (BGO.blocparms).

Please note that the tomograph defined in this example quite different from
any tomograph we are aware of, and any results derived from simulations using
these files should not be interpreted as giving any information about
actual tomographs.  The tomograph is specified as it is in order to make
the parameter files simple to understand and to keep the 'fast' in fastTest!

All true and scatter coincidences for which both photons have a detected energy
between 375 and 650 keV are binned by crystal pair (PETblock.binparms).  Randoms
are not modeled.  

runPETblock.sh runs the simulation.  

The script analyzePETblock.sh compares the results from the simulation with
results run on our computers.  The comparisons are made using
the SimSET utility 'ttest', which performs a t-test on the data bin-by-bin.
analyzePETblock.sh gives a summary of ttest's output for each simulation, e.g.:

Minimum T-Test value = -3.004
Maximum T-Test value = 2.314

0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 1.0  	= 198 => %65.56
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 2.0  	= 291 => %96.36
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.0  	= 301 => %99.67
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.00 	= 302, => %100.00


The absolute value of the ttest should be less than 1 approximately 67% of
the time, less than 2 approximately 95% of the time, and less than 3 over
99% of the time.  The maximum absolute value of the
ttest should be between 2.0 and 4.5.  The random nature of the data may lead
to a higher value on occasion, but the higher value should disappear if
the simulation and analysis are rerun.

If SimSET fails these conditions, further testing may be necessary.  Please
