This directory contains parameter files and data for a SimSET simulation. The
simulation can be run using the command runTOFPET.sh, and the resulting data
can be analyzed using analyzeTOFPET.sh.  These commands can also be run from
the parent directory (along with similar commands in the sibling directories)
using the commands runFast.sh and resultsFast.sh.

The object simulated is described in the %%ReadMe%% file in the parent 
directory. This simulation has importance sampling in the object, models 
positron range and non-collinearity, and models coherent scatter in the 
tomograph but not the object.  (See TOFPET.phgin.)

The collimator consists of 5 tungsten septa spread across the field-of-
view.  (See TOFPET.colparms.)

The modeled detector is a cylindrical LSO detector with 15% FWHM energy
resolution.  The time resolution is 0.424 nanoseconds on a per-photon
basis, yielding 0.6 nanosecond coincidence TOF resolution.  The
first interaction in the detector is forced (an importance sampling
feature).
(See TOFPET.detparms.)

The true and scatter data are binned together;  randoms are rejected.  The
coincidences for which the detected energies of both photons are between
400 and 650 keV are histogramed into 12 axial bins using SSRB, 10
transaxial distance bins, 15 azimuthal angle bins (phi), and 6 time-of-
flight bins.  
(See TOFPET.binparms.)

The script analyzeTOFPET.sh compares the results from the simulation with
results run on our computers.  The comparisons are made using
the SimSET utility 'ttest', which performs a t-test on the data bin-by-bin.
analyzeTOFPET.sh gives a summary of ttest's output for each simulation, e.g.:

Minimum T-Test value = -3.344
Maximum T-Test value = 3.487

0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 1.0          = 1182 => %67.97
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 2.0          = 1671 => %96.09
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.0          = 1733 => %99.65
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.49         = 1739, => %100.00


The absolute value of the ttest should be less than 1 approximately 67% of
the time, less than 2 approximately 95% of the time, and less than 3 over
99% of the time.  For this test the maximum absolute value of the
ttest should be between 2.5 and 4.5.  The random nature of the data may lead
to a higher value on occasion, but the higher value should disappear if
the simulation and analysis are rerun.

If SimSET fails these conditions, further testing may be necessary.  Please
