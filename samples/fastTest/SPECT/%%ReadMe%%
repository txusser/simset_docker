This directory contains parameter files and data for a SimSET simulation. The
simulation can be run using the command runSPECT.sh, and the resulting data
can be analyzed using analyzeSPECT.sh.  These commands can also be run from
the parent directory (along with similar commands in the sibling directories)
using the commands runFast.sh and resultsFast.sh.

The object simulated is described in the %%ReadMe%% file in the parent directory.
This simulation uses stratification in the object, and models coherent scatter
in both the object and tomograph.  (See SPECT.phgin.)

The collimator is parallel-beam, 2 cm thick, with 0.25 cm hole radius, and
0.01 cm septal thickness.  (See SPECT.colparms.)

The modeled detector is 2.5 cm NaI with a 0.1 cm aluminum front cover.
The detectors have perfect energy resolution.  (See SPECT.detparms.)

The detector and collimator have 25 step-and-shoot positions.

The data is binned into two scatter bins (true vs. scatter), 10 z bins,
15 transaxial distance bins and 25 azimuthal angle bins (phi).  (See
SPECT.binparms.)

The script analyzeSPECT.sh compares the results from the two simulations with
results from an earlier version of SimSET.  The comparisons are made using
the SimSET utility 'ttest', which performs a t-test on the data bin-by-bin.
analyzeSPECT.sh gives a summary of ttest's output for each simulation, e.g.:

Minimum T-Test value = -3.344
Maximum T-Test value = 3.487

0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 1.0          = 1182 => %67.97
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 2.0          = 1671 => %96.09
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.0          = 1733 => %99.65
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.49         = 1739, => %100.00


The absolute value of the ttest should be less than 1 approximately 67% of
the time, less than 2 approximately 95% of the time, and less than 3 over
99% of the time.  For this test the maximum absolute value of the
ttest should be between 2.5 and 4.5.  The random nature of the data may lead
to a higher value on occasion, but the higher value should disappear if
the simulation and analysis are rerun.

If SimSET fails these conditions, further testing may be necessary.  Please
