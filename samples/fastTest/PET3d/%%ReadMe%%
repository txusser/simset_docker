This directory contains parameter files and data for a SimSET simulation. The
simulation can be run using the command runPET3d.sh, and the resulting data
can be analyzed using analyzePET3d.sh.  These commands can also be run from
the parent directory (along with similar commands in the sibling directories)
using the commands runFast.sh and resultsFast.sh.

The object simulated is described in the %%ReadMe%% file in the parent 
directory.  This simulation has no importance sampling in the object, does 
not model positron range or non-collinearity, and models coherent scatter 
both in the object and the tomograph.  (See PET3d.phgin.)

The collimator consists of one septum (endplate) at each end of the field-of-
view.  The septa are made of aluminum, iron, and air with material changes 
both radially and axially.  (See PET3d.colparms.)

The detector has a thin aluminum front cover and is split into two axial
rings.  One ring consists of 3.5 cm of BGO, the other ring consists of 1.5
cm of NaI followed by 2 cm of BGO.  (See PET3d.detparms.)

The data is binned into two scatter bins (true vs. scatter), 12 azimuthal
angle bins (phi), 3 polar angle bins (theta), 8 transaxial distance bins
(xr), and 5 axial distance bins (yr).  (See PET3d.binparms.)

runPET3d.sh actually runs a partial second simulation using a detector history
file created during the first simulation.  The simulation is picked up after
the PHG module using the history file as input.

The script analyzePET3d.sh compares the results from the two simulations with
results from an earlier version of SimSET.  The comparisons are made using
the SimSET utility 'ttest', which performs a t-test on the data bin-by-bin.
analyzePET3d.sh gives a summary of ttest's output for each simulation, e.g.:

Minimum T-Test value = -3.344
Maximum T-Test value = 3.487

0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 1.0          = 1182 => %67.97
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 2.0          = 1671 => %96.09
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.0          = 1733 => %99.65
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.49         = 1739, => %100.00


The absolute value of the ttest should be less than 1 approximately 67% of
the time, less than 2 approximately 95% of the time, and less than 3 over
99% of the time.  For both the tests the maximum absolute value of the
ttest should be between 2.5 and 4.5.  The random nature of the data may lead
to a higher value on occasion, but the higher value should disappear if
the simulation and analysis are rerun.

If SimSET fails these conditions, further testing may be necessary.  Please
