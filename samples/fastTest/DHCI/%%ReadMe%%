This directory contains parameter files and data for a SimSET simulation. The
simulation can be run using the command runDHCI.sh, and the resulting data
can be analyzed using analyzeDHCI.sh.  These commands can also be run from
the parent directory (along with similar commands in the sibling directories)
using the commands runFast.sh and resultsFast.sh.

The object simulated is described in the %%ReadMe%% file in the parent directory.
This simulation has importance sampling in the object, models positron
range but not non-collinearity, and does not model coherent scatter.
(See DHCI.phgin.)

The tomograph is a dual-headed coincidence imager (DHCI) using two planar
detectors.

The collimator is a slat collimator consisting of two layers.  The first layer
has fours slats, two aluminum slats at the edges of the axial field-of-view
and two lead slats within the FOV.  The second layer has 3 slats, a lead slat,
an aluminum slat, and a lead slat.  (See DHCI.colparms.)

The modeled detectors are 2.5 cm NaI with a 0.1 cm aluminum front cover.
The detectors have 10% FWHM energy resolution.  (See DHCI.detparms.)

The data is binned into two scatter bins (true vs. scatter), 3x3 z bins
(3 z bins for each photon), 2x2 energy bins (2 bins for each photon), 5
transaxial distance bins and 8 azimuthal angle bins (phi).  (See
DHCI.binparms.)

runDHCI.sh runs a partial second simulation using a collimator history file
created during the first simulation.  The simulation is picked up after
the collimator module using the history file as input.

The script analyzeDHCI.sh compares the results from the two simulations with
results from an earlier version of SimSET.  The comparisons are made using
the SimSET utility 'ttest', which performs a t-test on the data bin-by-bin.
analyzeDHCI.sh gives a summary of ttest's output for each simulation, e.g.:

Minimum T-Test value = -3.344
Maximum T-Test value = 3.487

0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 1.0          = 1182 => %67.97
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 2.0          = 1671 => %96.09
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.0          = 1733 => %99.65
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.49         = 1739, => %100.00


The absolute value of the ttest should be less than 1 approximately 67% of
the time, less than 2 approximately 95% of the time, and less than 3 over
99% of the time.  For this test the maximum absolute value of the
ttest should be between 2.5 and 4.5.  The random nature of the data may lead
to a higher value on occasion, but the higher value should disappear if
the simulation and analysis are rerun.

If SimSET fails these conditions, further testing may be necessary.  Please
