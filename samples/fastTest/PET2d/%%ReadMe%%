This directory contains parameter files and data for a SimSET simulation. The
simulation can be run using the command runPET2d.sh, and the resulting data
can be analyzed using analyzePET2d.sh.  These commands can also be run from
the parent directory (along with similar commands in the sibling directories)
using the commands runFast.sh and resultsFast.sh.

The object simulated is described in the %%ReadMe%% file in the parent directory.
This simulation has importance sampling in the object, models positron
range and non-collinearity, and models coherent scatter in the tomograph
but not the object.  (See PET2d.phgin.)

The collimator consists of four aluminum septa spread across the field-of-
view.  (See PET2d.colparms.)

The modeled detector is a cylindrical LSO detector with 15% FWHM energy
resolution.  While it is  a solid chunk of LSO, it is represented as two 
axial rings each consisting of two radial layers.  The data from this 
simulation is compared to a simulation where the LSO is represented as 
one piece to help validate the tracking across ring/layer boundaries.
(See PET2d.detparms.)

The data is binned into two scatter bins (true vs. scatter), 2x2 z bins
(2 z bins for each photon), 2x2 energy bins (2 bins for each photon), 10
transaxial distance bins and 15 azimuthal angle bins (phi).  (See
PET2d.binparms.)

The script analyzePET2d.sh compares the results from the two simulations with
results from an earlier version of SimSET.  The comparisons are made using
the SimSET utility 'ttest', which performs a t-test on the data bin-by-bin.
analyzePET2d.sh gives a summary of ttest's output for each simulation, e.g.:

Minimum T-Test value = -3.344
Maximum T-Test value = 3.487

0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 1.0          = 1182 => %67.97
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 2.0          = 1671 => %96.09
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.0          = 1733 => %99.65
0.0 <= |T-Test| <= 3.49         = 1739, => %100.00


The absolute value of the ttest should be less than 1 approximately 67% of
the time, less than 2 approximately 95% of the time, and less than 3 over
99% of the time.  For this test the maximum absolute value of the
ttest should be between 2.5 and 4.5.  The random nature of the data may lead
to a higher value on occasion, but the higher value should disappear if
the simulation and analysis are rerun.

If SimSET fails these conditions, further testing may be necessary.  Please
